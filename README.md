## About The Project

This project provides a visualization tool for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms.

There have been tons of single agent path finding visualization websites, yet they all make use of well-established algorithms such as A star and Dijkstra. the field of multi agent path finding is relatively new (CBS, an important MAPF algorithm, was proposed in 2012).

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com)
- [MUI](https://mui.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Open [MAPF Visualizer](http://mapf-visualizer) in Chrome v98 and later for optimal support.

## Contributing

If you have a MAPF-related algorithm that might fit into the framework of this website, please reach out to me via [email](yli81711@usc.edu) and I'll be very willing to incorporate it into the website.

## More to implement

- Add pages for more detailed information about MAPF algorithms and corresponding papers.
- Include more MAPF algorithms (CSB-based, SAT-based, etc.) for users to choose which one to run their MAPF instance on.
- Include some other MAPF variants, such as k-robust and lifelong NAPF.
- ...
